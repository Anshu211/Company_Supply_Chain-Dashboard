# Company_Supply_Chain-Dashboard
Dataset is about a company's sales made from multiple departmental stores across the world with details of the sale, discount, profit, product, customer, store and location data.

I would like to thank Coding Invaders for providing the dataset used in this project.


Project Overview

This Power BI Dashboard project aims to analyze and improve the company's supply chain operations. It provides insights into sales, profits, delivery performance, and department-level analysis. By visualizing the data, the project helps identify regions and product categories for improvement, highlights the best performing products, and showcases top customers.

    Orders: Contains information about order details, customers, and delivery status.
    Product: Includes data about products, their categories, and descriptions.
    Customer: Contains customer information, such as name, ID, and segment.
    Departments: Provides details about store departments, including names and IDs.
